Place your answers to any of the exercises in this `member_answers`
folder. Please name the files according to the exercise name, with your username
appended. For example, if I want to share my answers to
`exercise_3_refactor_this.rb` then I'd create a new file in the `member_answers`
folder and call it `exercise_3_refactor_this_pat.rb`. You can commit that to a
new branch, push it to your cloned repo on the GitLab, and then send me a pull
request. The more people that share their answers, the more we can learn from
one another!
